# Designing a Beam for a Commercial Building (Analysis Efforts)

The program enables:
1. **Calculating reactions at the supports** to ensure the beam's static equilibrium.
2. **Generating shear force and bending moment diagrams,** critical for identifying maximum stress locations.
3. **Evaluating the beam's deflection** to ensure deformations are within code limits.
4. **Analyzing maximum normal stresses** to verify the integrity of the chosen material.

**Visualization and Interpretation:**
- The engineer uses interactive plots to quickly identify critical points.
- The combined plot provides a consolidated overview, useful for project team meetings or client presentations.

**Conclusion:**
This program aids in making informed technical decisions regarding the beam's size and material, allowing adjustments to be made before construction to ensure safety and functionality.
